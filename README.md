Jacopo Chergui is an italian computer engineer and musician, born to build solutions and good sounds.

For all the information about Jacopo, please check the website. In this README file, we will focus on the building process of the website, developing a timeline of the incremental progress. 
The approach is to build something very slowly, but not for lazyness. 
The main reasons are:
1. Constantly review details, focusing on quality and not on 'fancy' functionalities just to impress at a superficial level.
2. The focus is on building something modular, that works indepentently from the estetics or colour palette. So, we will focus more on the architecture. Initially, the changes made every time will seem not very noticeable, but in reality there's always something cooking.
3. *Ars longa, vita brevis*. This could appear as an excuse to slowness and chill out instead of 'doing things', but the reality is that if I don't spend time on development, I'm spending time in studying, reading or even other aspects of life that enrich my cultural baggage, and this is a benefit for the website and the other projects I work on. This could be a course about tech stuff, playing/studying music, a nature-filled journey, sport activities or even just relax - nothing is lost.

This is the manifesto. Will I regret this philosophy? Until is applied to my personal projects, there are no negative effects. I will make mistakes, yes, but I'm learning to embrace them, and make them a point of improvement.
